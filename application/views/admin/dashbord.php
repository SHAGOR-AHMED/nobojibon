            <p>In Bangladesh, both at rural and urban settings, a huge number of populations are fighting for coping with poverty, hunger as well as illiteracy from generation to generation. For their education, economic graduation, creating of livelihood opportunities is crucial through improving life skills. Nobo Jibon set off in 1998 in the heart of the south-western district Satkhira by Mr. Shahid Khan living in London and left Bangladesh 54 years back, giving highest priority on ensuring education and socio-economic development of the by-passed, disadvantaged and vulnerable segment of the community. Nobo Jibon is transforming the poor and vulnerable community as a change maker of their own fate and has been implementing various programs by following a integrated development approach (IDA). The well designed sustainable programs of Nobo Jibon through covering huge number of beneficiaries is definitely contributing towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Nobo Jibon is now operating its activities all over the countries and plans to expand its interventions gradually in challenging and hard to reach areas to address the dire needs of the people who are deprived from education and other basic rights and continuously fighting against poverty.</p>
