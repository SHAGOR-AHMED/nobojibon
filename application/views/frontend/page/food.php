                According to Islam, Ramadan is the most precious month of a year, when people beseech the blessings and guidance of Allah in more ways extra prayer, fasting, sadaka etc. The lesson of the month is to feel the pain of hunger and refrain one from all ill doings and thoughts. During Ramadan, NoboJibon has distributed Food Parcel to Poor Widows and Distressed peoples of Satkhira sadar upazila. Poor widows and distressed people are facing lot of troubles to fast in hot summer without sufficient amounts of food. The purpose of the Food Parcel distribution was to give sufficient quantity of food among the poor widows and distressed people for Ramadan fasting. Target of food parcel distribution were 1008 and we have distributed 1008 food parcels during the reporting period.<br><br>

                Due to poverty and low level of income most of the vulnerable, widow, distressed, displaced and orphan family could not manage their meal every day and for this reasons, the family members suffers malnutrition. Considering the situation, Nobo Jibon periodically arrange food parcel and distributed among the beneficiaries particularly in the month of Ramadan so that the beneficiaries can observe the month of Ramadan by having nutritional food with the support of different donor agencies. Besides, Nobo Jibon also distributed Iftar, fitrana, Zakat among the vulnerable population in the society.<br><br>

                During the Eid-Ul-Azha which is known as big festival for the Muslims, Nobo Jibon distributed Qurbani meat among the most vulnerable, widow and orphan families with the support of different donor agencies so that the vulnerable families can observe festival with a happy mode. Nobo Jibon implements these activities in the different districts of Bangladesh.<br><br>

                The Food Parcel and the Qurbani program already helped a lot to increase the image of Nobo Jibon in the society. Besides, this program inspired the rich man, local elites, local government representative to come forward to helping the poor. The program already reminded the local rich man and other elites that they have also the responsibility for their neighbors as a Muslims. This program expects that in future these rich man and local elites will come forward to help the poor and vulnerable families to improve the financial condition.<br><br>

                All these families were living under poverty line. Some of them were also street beggar. But they are pious Muslims. In this Qurbani, this meat supply support helped them to enjoy the Eid-Ul-Fitr and Eid-Ul-Adha with their family members. Undoubtedly, the beneficiaries prayed to the Almighty Allah for Nobo Jibon for their much better future. This program is one sort event and it is very difficult to measures the sustainability of the program but it will contribute to change the attitude of the rich man and local elites to the poor and vulnerable people in the society.
