                Human trafficking is the worst form of human rights violation. Especially trafficking in women and children is not a new phenomenon either within the South Asian region or globally. In recent years, trends of human trafficking have changed and Bangladeshi men are also becoming victims of trafficking at an alarming rate under cover of migration abroad. Human rights groups in Bangladesh estimate that between 10,000 and 20,000 women and girls are trafficked annually to India, Pakistan, Bahrain, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates. In Bangladesh, it is not only women and girls that are trafficked, but a significant number of boys and men are also trafficked internally and internationally for sexual explopitation. So in the alarming areas of our working points we are awaring the community people about the danger of human trafficking and how to remove it from our society. Now NOBO JIBON is implementing the programme againest human trafficking and it is continuous by the fund of Relief International & Bangladesh NGO Foundation (BNF).
