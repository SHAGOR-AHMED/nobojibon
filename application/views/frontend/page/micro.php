                Nobo Jibon's projects include helping families to have a source of income. We employ a number of trained Field workers to organize village women in Bangladesh as a economic community to care for their village, environment, economy and health care. To our surprise, we discover they are quite capable of doing the job we ask them to do. From their recommendation we advance credit to individuals for the economic development. Thus we giving loan them to buy cow, goat, chicken, ducks, sewing-machine, rickshaw, village-shop etc for make them self reliant. We find them hardworking, responsible and trustworthy. We help the women to be financially healthy because they in turn care for their children's education and health. Our experience shows that mother feed the children before she eats her own food and care for their need before her own. Thus by helping mother we are also helping indirectly the children. Within a few years of our support, we find the villages are much cleaner, people are healthier and new houses are being built in place of the shacks. In place of extreme poverty and despair there exist a sense of purpose and hope for the future. The experience we have gained through our work and developed expertise could be used much widely if we had enough money.<br><br>

                These days microfinance operation has become a globally recognized approach for reducing poverty in the developing and least countries. Its role in socio-economic development of the poor people is inevitable as it helps make the capital and access to financial/banking to these people. Bangladesh is the birthplace of microcredit programs of the world. Realizing the importance of microcredit, Nobo Jibon started its savings and credit programs in 1998 to encourage increasing the income of the poor through income generating activities (IGA’s) and micro enterprises. Nobo Jibon provides access to financial services to the poor who are unable to obtain credit from mainstream banks due to lack of necessary assets and referrals. The borrowers, most of whom are women, use these loans to engage in various income generating activities to improve their socio-economic status. Nobo Jibon experiences suggests that only microcredit is not enough to tackle poverty and the poor also need a package of other services like health, nutrition, education etc. for their economic empowerment. Therefore, Nobo Jibon follows an integrated development approach in micro-finance program that aims to alleviate poverty not only through income generation but through an integrated approach. Integrated development is the system of collectively implementing health, economic and education initiatives to strategically meet a community’s development goals.
